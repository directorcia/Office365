You are an expert security analyst with strong experience in the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Essential Eight (E8) strategies and Microsoft Secure Score data analysis.

I have provided a JSON file containing our organization’s Microsoft 365 security configuration and control scores. Please do the following:

1. **Load and Analyse the Data:**
   - Use Python (pandas) to load and parse the JSON data. Identify key data points relevant to the E8 strategies, such as Secure Score percentages, MFA status, conditional access policies, enabled/disabled controls, device compliance data, and any other fields that provide insight into patching, user and admin privileges, and backup practices.
   - For each of the Essential Eight strategies (Patch Applications, Patch Operating Systems, User Application Hardening, Restrict Administrative Privileges, Multi-Factor Authentication, Application Control, Restrict Office Macros, Regular Backups), evaluate our current posture based on the evidence in the dataset. Look for indicators of compliance or lack thereof (e.g., whether MFA is enforced for all accounts; OS and application patch compliance; presence of Safe Attachments/Safe Links policies; existence of Privileged Identity Management; backup policies, etc.).

2. **Compute Metrics & Create Visualizations:**
   - Calculate relevant metrics such as the percentage of users with MFA enabled vs. disabled; breakdown of Secure Score by category; number of risky configurations (e.g., accounts without MFA, unassigned roles); proportion of device compliance; etc.
   - Generate at least two clear and professional charts or graphs to illustrate key compliance metrics—for example:
     - A bar chart comparing our score in each of the E8 strategies (e.g., Patch OS, Patch Apps, etc.).
     - A pie chart showing the distribution of MFA registration (registered vs. unregistered accounts).
     - Any other relevant visualizations derived from the dataset.
   - Use Python libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn to create these charts. Save each chart as an image file in the working directory.

3. **Create a Customer-Facing Report:**
   - Compile a structured report (in Markdown) that is polished, clear, and accessible for non-technical stakeholders. Use headers to divide the report into meaningful sections:
     - **Executive Summary**: Summarize the overall E8 compliance status, highlighting key strengths and areas needing attention.
     - **Methodology**: Briefly describe how the Secure Score data was analyzed and how metrics were derived.
     - **Detailed Findings for Each Essential Eight Control**: For each strategy, include:
       - A summary of the E8 requirements (with citations to official ACSC guidance if available).
       - Evidence from the data (e.g., controls enabled/disabled, policies enforced, compliance percentages).
       - A clear narrative explaining whether our current controls align with the E8 requirements.
       - A concise list of recommendations or next steps to improve compliance.
     - **Visualizations & Table**: Include the charts/graphs created in step 2 and a table summarizing the findings. The table should have columns such as “Essential 8 Control,” “Key Data/Evidence,” “Current Status,” and “Recommendations.”
     - **Conclusion**: Provide a final assessment of our E8 maturity level (e.g., partially compliant, early maturity, etc.) and outline a high-level roadmap to achieve full compliance.

4. **Embed Charts and Generate a Downloadable Report:**
   - Embed the charts and any relevant tables into the report for clarity. Ensure they are clearly labeled and referenced in the text.
   - Save the report as a Markdown file (e.g., `essential8_compliance_report.md`). After generating the file, use the appropriate function to sync the file to a downloadable link (e.g., `computer.sync_file`) so the report can be retrieved easily.
   - Reference all sources correctly for E8 guidance or standards (if pulled from external references, cite using the appropriate tool syntax, e.g., `【<citation_id>†L<line_start>-L<line_end>】`). However, ensure that the final report itself is stand-alone and understandable without having to check those citations.

**Input File:**
- `secure-score-data_ciaopslabs-onmicrosoft-com_2026-01-22_compact.json` — Microsoft Secure Score export containing data on M365 security controls (MFA registration, policy states, compliance scores, etc.)

**Expected Output:**
- A polished, customer-facing Microsoft Word report file (e.g., `essential8_compliance_report.docx`) with embedded charts, tables, analysis, and recommendations. The report must be easily downloadable and shareable.

Use professional language with a friendly tone, clear explanations, and minimal jargon to ensure accessibility for stakeholders who may not be security experts.
